# UNRELEASED

# 0.7 - 2024-02-27

- Fix: Union types are now flattened (i.e. if a union has a type which is another union, they will be combined).
- Feature / breaking change: add `preserve_non_string_maps` and change default behavior to turn all maps into string-keyed ones.

# 0.6.1 - 2024-02-27

- Fix: `collapse_fields` was only working on the first instance of the field, not when it was found inside a map etc. later on.

# 0.5 - 2024-02-26

- Fix: oneofs were not being emitted.
